# IP of hosts to ignore for ICMP Whitecap rules
# Add IP addresses to ICMP_SRC_HOSTS if you have setup scanning devices that use ICMP pings to do host checks
# and the ICMP packet uses a different payload than whitelisted below
# This is often needed for systems like load balancers that constantly ping back end nodes to make sure they are
# online
ipvar ICMP_SRC_HOSTS_IGNORE [192.168.0.1]
# Add IP addresses to ICMP_DST_HOSTS if you have special systems that a custom ICMP ping gets generated against
ipvar ICMP_DST_HOSTS_IGNORE [192.168.0.1]
